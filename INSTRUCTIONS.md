# CSV to JSON Conversion

This project includes a script to convert CSV files to JSON format.

## Prerequisites

- You must have Node.js and npm installed.
- Your CSV files must be placed in the `/csv` folder.

## Running the script

1. **Install dependencies:**
   Open your terminal in the project root and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the conversion script:**
   ```bash
   node convertCSVtoJSON.js
   ```

This will read all `.csv` files from the `/csv` directory, convert them to JSON, and save them in the `/public/data` directory.

**Note:** The script is currently a placeholder and needs the data models from `GEMINI.md` to be fully functional.
