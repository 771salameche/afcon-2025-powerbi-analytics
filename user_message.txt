I've updated the script to read CSVs from the `tables` directory, and I see the CSV files are present there.

However, to properly implement the data type conversions (numbers, booleans, dates) and ensure the JSON output matches your desired structure, I still critically need the data model specifications from your `GEMINI.md` file.

Could you please provide the relevant sections from `GEMINI.md` that describe the data models for:
- Teams
- Fixtures
- Players
- Venues
- Tournament_Stages
- Player_Statistics
- Team_Statistics
- Goals
- Cards
- Tournament_Summary

Once I have these details, I can complete the `convertCSVtoJSON.js` script to accurately convert your CSV data.
